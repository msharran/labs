# Dev Containers

# Why use Dockerfile?

Read [this](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/create-dev-container#_rebuild)

TL;DR: Dockerfile is built before dev-container creation. It can be used to install tools and dependencies.
Use `postCreateCommand` to run commands after the container is created. (Scripts that require project files to be present)
