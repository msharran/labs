This software is modular (i.e., the `fiobj` and `evio` modules) and each module should be considered independantly licensed under the MIT license.

This software implements cryptographic algorithms such as SHA1, SHA2 and SipHash.

It should be noted that different countries might restrict the use / importation (download) of cryptographic devices / software. You should make sure to comply with the laws of the appilicable country/countries.

These algorithms might be subject to their own copyrights, patents and licenses, though I couldn't find any that apply I really don't know - you should test this on your own.

SipHash - from https://131002.net/siphash/

> We aren't aware of any patents or patent applications relevant to SipHash. SipHash was designed by:
> * Jean-Philippe Aumasson (Kudelski Security, Switzerland)
> * Daniel J. Bernstein (University of Illinois at Chicago, USA)

SHA1 and SHA2

SHA1 and SHA2 seem to be in the public domain, developed by/for NASA.
